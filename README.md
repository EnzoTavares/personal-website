<h1 align="center"> Personal WebSite </h1>

<p align="center">
This is a personal website I created using only HTML and CSS, without any frameworks. <br> 
I wanted to use native CSS to improve my knowledge of CSS and to better understand how frameworks can be really helpful. <br>
On this website, you will find my CVs, some projects I have created, and more about me.<br/>
